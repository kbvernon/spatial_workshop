## Basics

Load the `sf`, `raster`, `spData`, and `spDataLarge` packages.

```{r}

```


## sf

Datasets are "lazy" loaded, meaning when you load the package, the datasets are kinda just there in the background of your R session. Try printing the world dataset with `print`, but limit the number of rows printed to 5 using the `n` parameter. 

```{r}


```

Now extract New Zealand and assign it to a new object. Call it "nz". Hint: use the `name_long` variable.

```{r}

```

Now plot only the geometry of New Zealand.

```{r}

```

Try creating an sf object from scratch. Start by making two simple feature geometries (`sfg`), then add those to a simple feature column (`sfc`), and finally add that as a geometry column to an simple feature (`sf`). Make sure to add a `crs` to the `sfc`!

```{r}

```



## raster

Load the categorical raster from the spDataLarge package and plot it. Call it `cat_raster`.

```{r, warning = TRUE}

fn <- system.file("raster/nlcd2011.tif", package = "spDataLarge")

cat_raster <- raster(fn)

```


Load the continuous raster from the spDataLarge package and plot it. Call it `con_raster`.

```{r}

fn <- system.file("raster/srtm.tif", package = "spDataLarge")



```

Find the extent of `cat_raster`.

```{r}

```


Make a raster from scratch. Use the NAD83 UTM 12 crs and assign it random values. Call it `new_raster`.

```{r}

utm12 <- "+proj=utm +zone=12 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs"



```

Find the extent of `new_raster`.

```{r}

```




## Projecting

Check the crs of `world`. What is its proj4string?

```{r}

```

Check the crs of `con_raster`.

```{r}

```

Plot the geometry of the `nz` object. Then create a new object called `nz_moll` by reprojecting the `nz` object to the Mollweide projection ("+proj=moll"). Plot the geometry of the result.

```{r}

```

Transform the `world` dataset to the transverse Mercator projection ("+proj=tmerc") and plot the result.

```{r}

```

Transform the continuous raster (`con_raster`) into NAD83 / UTM zone 12N using the nearest neighbor interpolation method. What has changed? How does it influence the results? Plot the result.

```{r}

```

Transform the categorical raster (`cat_raster`) into WGS 84 using the bilinear interpolation method. What has changed? How does it influence the results? Plot the result.

```{r}

```

Transform `new_raster` to WGS84 and plot it.

```{r}

```
