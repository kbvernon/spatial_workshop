      "contents": "\r\nSlides and worksheets for a three day workshop providing an introduction to working with spatial data in R. Mostly, that means learning how to work with the sf and raster packages. The content and exercises are designed for 3 two-hour meetings.\r\nAll lessons are based on Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow (2021) Geocomputation with R. Itâ€™s open-source and freely available here. This is an excellent resource, and something I find myself consulting quite often. Exercises are a mix of the exercises provided in that text and my own additions.\r\nOutline:\r\nDay One: Introduction\r\nInstallation and a brief overview of vector and raster data\r\nReading and writing spatial data\r\nProjecting spatial data\r\nReading: Ch 2, 6, and 7\r\n\r\nDay Two: Change, Subset, and Select Data\r\nAttribute data operations\r\nSpatial data operations\r\nReading: Ch 3 and 4\r\n\r\nDay Three: Change Geometry and Plot\r\nGeometry data operations\r\nMaking pretty maps\r\nReading: Ch 5 and 8\r\n\r\n",
