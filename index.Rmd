Slides and worksheets for a three day workshop providing an introduction to working with spatial data in R. Mostly, that means learning how to work with the [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and [raster](https://rspatial.github.io/raster/reference/raster-package.html) packages. The content and exercises are designed for 3 two-hour meetings.  

All lessons are based on __Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow (2021) Geocomputation with R__. Itâ€™s open-source and freely available [here](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/). This is an excellent resource, and something I find myself consulting quite often. Exercises are a mix of the exercises provided in that text and my own additions.  

Outline:

1. __Day One: Introduction__
    *	Installation and a brief overview of vector and raster data
    * Reading and writing spatial data
